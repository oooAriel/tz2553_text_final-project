Abstract

The purpose of this study is to utilize natural language processing to analyze the sentiment trends of news articles regarding public attitudes toward the US-China trade war. Since sentiment analysis enables audiences to comprehend public opinions, policymakers' sentiments, and news perception in real time, it facilitates data-driven decision-making. As a crucial link between the public and policymakers, it is essential to accurately gauge the sentiment of the story.

To address the research question, 'What is the sentiment and main concerns associated with news articles on public attitudes toward the US-China trade war, as reflected in the analyzed articles from 2019 to 2023, and how does it change before and after Covid?' I analyze the content of various articles using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), sentiment analysis, and word cloud visualizations.

The findings reveal a negative sentiment of news articles on public attitude toward the US-China trade war, and the word cloud illustrates the most prevalent issues associated with the trade war, providing insight into a discernible trend over time. The study concludes that the sentiment of news articles on public attitudes towards the US-China trade war is not as neutral as expected and shows a trend closely related to the political relationship between the two countries.
